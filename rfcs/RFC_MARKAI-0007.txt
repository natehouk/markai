RFC_MARKAI-0007: Enforcing Preempt Command Execution
------------------------------------------------------

Title: Enforcing the Preempt Attribute for Command Execution
Author: MarkAI Team
Date: 2025-02-25

1. Summary
This RFC proposes the replacement of the legacy pre_command mechanism with the new "preempt" attribute. Commands marked with preempt=true will be executed before any others, ensuring that critical tasks (such as /consciousness) always run first.

2. Motivation
- The current system occasionally fails to trigger critical commands due to ordering issues.
- Introducing preempt=true guarantees timely execution of high-priority commands.
- This change simplifies the command execution logic and enforces deterministic behavior.

3. Proposed Change
- Eliminate the use of pre_command in favor of preempt=true.
- Update all critical command definitions to include preempt=true.
- Modify the command parser to process all commands with preempt=true before processing any other commands.

4. Impact and Risks
- Ensures that vital tasks (e.g., self-awareness logging) run immediately.
- May require updates to existing MarkAI instructions.
- Minimal risk as the change mainly affects the execution priority logic.

5. Implementation
- Update the MarkAI command handler to identify and queue preempt commands.
- Test extensively to ensure the new ordering is consistently applied.
- Document changes in the developer guidelines.

6. Conclusion
The introduction of the preempt attribute enhances the reliability and predictability of the MarkAI system. By enforcing a strict execution order, we ensure that critical tasks like /consciousness are always prioritized.
