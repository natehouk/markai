# RFC 0005: Standardizing Human-Readable Annotations Ignored by AI

**Status:** Final  
**Author:** MarkAI Team  
**Date:** October 12, 2023

## Abstract
This document delineates the protocol for embedding human-readable annotations within MarkAI configuration files that are to be excluded from AI command processing. The revised standard mandates that such annotations be enclosed by an opening tag (“<!--ai-ignore>”) and a closing tag (“</ai-ignore>”). This approach eliminates ambiguity by ensuring that AI systems disregard the enclosed annotations while maintaining clarity for human readers.

## 1. Introduction
Previous versions of the MarkAI configuration specifications employed HTML comment tags with ancillary prefixes to delineate human-readable comments. Developer feedback necessitated the establishment of an unambiguous syntax. This RFC supersedes former conventions by defining a singular, formalized format for human-readable annotations.

## 2. Rationale
   a. Unambiguity: The exclusive use of the “<!--ai-ignore>” … “</ai-ignore>” tag sequence unambiguously marks sections that must be ignored by AI processing systems.  
   b. Consistency: All annotations—whether embedded in `.markairules`, `.markai/CHANGELOG.txt`, or related files—must conform to this uniform standard.  
   c. Tooling: Future automation tools shall reliably detect and remove content encapsulated within the specified tags during processing.

## 3. Specification
   a. Syntax:  
      Every human-readable annotation intended for exclusion must be enclosed between an opening tag “<!--ai-ignore>” and a closing tag “</ai-ignore>”.  
      
      Example:
      ```html
      <!--ai-ignore>
          This annotation is provided solely for human reference and will not be processed by the AI.
      </ai-ignore>
      ```
   b. Placement:  
      Such annotations may be inserted anywhere within a configuration file provided that they do not interfere with the structural syntax of executable instructions.
   c. Legacy Comments:  
      Any existing annotations not conforming to this standard must be revised accordingly. All developers are advised to update legacy files to ensure uniformity.

## 4. Examples of Implementation
### In a Bootstrapping Configuration File (`.markairules`)
Before:
```html
<!-- HUMAN COMMENT: This block handles repository analysis -->
```
After:
```html
<!--ai-ignore>
    This block handles repository analysis.
</ai-ignore>
```

## 5. Implementation and Compliance
   a. Review: All configuration and RFC files are subject to review to verify adherence to this standard.  
   b. Tool Integration: Automated tooling must be updated to identify and exclude content within “<!--ai-ignore>” tags.  
   c. Audit: Regular audits shall be conducted to ensure compliance with this guideline.

## 6. Conclusion
By establishing this formal standard, the MarkAI system will ensure that human-readable annotations remain clearly separated from executable instructions. The consistent use of the “<!--ai-ignore>” tags across all files enhances the integrity of AI command processing and minimizes potential errors.
