                AI Instruction Tag Format Specification

Status of this Memo:
This memorandum formally documents a standard for embedding machine-readable AI processing instructions within text files. Distribution of this memo is unrestricted.

Abstract:
This document specifies a standardized format for embedding AI processing instructions within text files. It employs XML-style tags for machine-readability, complemented by HTML-style comments for human-readable annotations. This dual-format methodology ensures that instructions are processed automatically while explanatory notes remain accessible for human review, thereby preventing recursive processing issues.

1. Introduction
The increasing reliance on AI systems necessitates a standardized methodology for incorporating machine-processable instructions into text files. This document introduces such a format, ensuring clarity, consistency, and the avoidance of processing ambiguities.

2. Instruction Format
2.1. AI Instruction Tag:
   - Standard Format:
     <ai_instruction>
       [Instruction content]
     </ai_instruction>
   - Protected Content:
     Instructions enclosed within `<ai_instruction locked="true">` are immutable and cannot be altered by automated processes.

2.2. Human-Readable Comments:
   - Annotations not intended for processing shall be enclosed using the "ai-ignore" syntax:
     <!--ai-ignore
         [Human-readable comment content]
     ai-ignore-->

3. Processing Rules
   - Each instruction tag is to be processed exactly once.
   - Nested instruction tags are not processed.
   - Content within ai-ignore annotations is ignored during processing.
   - Instructions marked with `locked="true"` are strictly immutable.
   - Malformed or recursive tags trigger error handling protocols.

4. Usage Guidelines
   - Each instruction should be accompanied by appropriate human-readable annotations.
   - The standard ensures clarity and maintainability, facilitating both machine processing and human verification.
   - All instructions must adhere strictly to this standardized format.

5. Examples
   Basic Instruction:
   <ai_instruction>
     Format this text as JSON.
   </ai_instruction>

   Instruction with Human-Readable Comment:
   <ai_instruction>
     Process the content.
     <!--ai-ignore
         This annotation is for human reference only.
     ai-ignore-->
     Format as JSON.
   </ai_instruction>

   Protected Content:
   <ai_instruction locked="true">
     This content is immutable.
   </ai_instruction>

6. Test Cases
6.1. Immutability Tests:
   - Any attempt to alter locked content must result in an ImmutableModificationError.
   - Partial modifications of locked content are strictly prohibited.

Conclusion:
This RFC establishes a rigorous standard for embedding AI processing instructions within text files, ensuring that the system maintains both machine precision and human clarity.
