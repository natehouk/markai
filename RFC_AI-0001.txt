Abstract

   This document specifies a standardized format for embedding machine-
   readable AI processing instructions within text files. The format
   uses XML-style tags for instructions and HTML-style comments for human
   annotations, providing both machine processability and human
   readability while preventing recursive processing issues.

1. Introduction

   The increasing use of AI systems in text processing has created a need
   for a standardized way to embed processing instructions within text
   files. This document specifies such a format.

1.1. The Halting Problem and AI Processing

   A fundamental challenge in AI instruction processing is the potential
   for recursive interpretation - where an AI system processes instructions
   about processing instructions, potentially leading to an infinite loop.
   This is a practical manifestation of the halting problem in computer
   science.

   The format addresses this challenge through the ai-ignore comment
   syntax, which creates explicit boundaries between processable
   instructions and human meta-commentary. This prevents AI systems from
   recursively processing comments about processing, while maintaining
   the ability for humans to document and explain the instructions.

2. Core Format

2.1. AI Instruction Tag
    <ai_instruction>
    [instruction content]
    </ai_instruction>

    Optional: Prevent modification
    <ai_instruction modify="false">
    [protected content]
    </ai_instruction>

2.2. Human Comments
    <!--ai-ignore
    [human comment content]
    ai-ignore-->

3. Processing Rules

3.1. Basic Requirements
- Process each instruction tag exactly once
- Never process nested instruction tags
- Skip all content within ai-ignore comments
- Honor modify="false" directives
- Stop if processing depth exceeds 5 levels

3.2. Error Handling
- Skip malformed tags
- Only process outermost tag when nested
- Treat invalid attributes as modify="false"

4. Usage Guidelines

4.1. Writing Instructions
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- One instruction per tag
- Add human comments for context
- Avoid nesting instructions

4.2. Writing Comments
- Use comments to explain "why"
- Keep comments current
- Document dependencies
- Explain complex requirements

5. Examples

Basic Instruction:
<ai_instruction>
Format this text as JSON
</ai_instruction>

With Human Comment:
<ai_instruction>
Format this text
<!--ai-ignore
This needs special formatting for legacy systems
ai-ignore-->
as JSON
</ai_instruction>

Protected Content:
<ai_instruction modify="false">
Do not modify this instruction
</ai_instruction>
